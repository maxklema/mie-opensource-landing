Learn the fundamentals of Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE), understand the interface, and discover how virtualization works in our cluster environment.

### Ready to Build?
**[Create Your First Container â†’](/docs/creating-containers/basic-containers/command-line)**

Step-by-step guide to creating and configuring your own Linux container (LXC) from scratch. Perfect for hosting applications, development environments, or testing new software.

### Want to Deploy Applications Automatically?
**[Advanced Container Deployment â†’](/docs/creating-containers/advanced-containers/deploying-containers-overview)**

Learn how to automatically deploy your applications during container creation, with support for single and multi-component applications.

### Automate Your Deployments with GitHub
**[Proxmox Launchpad Integration â†’](/docs/proxmox-launchpad/what-is-proxmox-launchpad)**

Connect your GitHub repositories to automatically deploy your projects to the cluster using our custom GitHub Actions workflow. Set up CI/CD pipelines that build and deploy directly to your Proxmox containers.

### Develop with VSCode
**[VSCode Remote Development â†’](/docs/vscode-setup)**

Connect VSCode directly to your containers for seamless remote development with full IDE capabilities.
